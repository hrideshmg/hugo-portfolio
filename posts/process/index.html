        <p>A brief explanation of my journey in making this website</p>
<h2 id="figuring-out-what-hugo-actually-is">Figuring out what Hugo actually is</h2>
<p>When I first saw the task statement on the document I thought this was going to be pretty easy since I already had some very beginner experience hosting a website using flask, but when I downloaded the theme I was puzzled as to where the html or css files were.</p>
<p>After a bit of digging I found out that Hugo is actually a website generator and the themes are essentially templates we use to generate our websites, armed with that knowledge I started following the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">quickstart guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="unexpected-errors">Unexpected Errors</h2>
<p>Everything was going fine.. until it wasnt (<em>*cue ominous music*</em>). On running the command to create a new post: <code>hugo new content posts/first-post.md</code>, I got a weird error, I thought no problem, ill just google it but to my dismay there were no stackoverflow pages for this particular error, I wasted around 30 mins googling around trying different queries but to no avail.</p>
<p>Finally I decided to read through the quickstart page again, and thats when I realized that in my hastiness I had glossed over a very important piece of information: The version requirement written in the prerequisites, the apt package manager had installed an older version of Hugo, I proceeded to install the newer version using snap and bingo everything was working fine.</p>
<p><strong>Moral of the story:</strong> Read through the docs if googling fails</p>
<h2 id="things-i-learned">Things I learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>How to use hugo to create static webpages</li>
<li>How to import themes into hugo and customize them</li>
<li>The <code>git submodule</code> command, which lets us use external repositories in our own repo&rsquo;s.</li>
</ul>
